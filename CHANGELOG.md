# JSON P3 Change Log

## Version 0.3.0 (unreleased)

**Fixes**

- Fixed call stack size issues when querying large datasets with the recursive descent selector. This was mostly due to extending arrays using the spread operator. We now iterate and use `Array.push()`.

**Features**

- Added `jsonpath.lazyQuery()`, a lazy alternative to `jsonpath.query()`. `lazyQuery()` can be faster and more memory efficient if querying large datasets, especially when using recursive descent selectors. Conversely, `query()` is usually the better choice when working with small datasets.
- `jsonpath.match()` now uses `lazyQuery()` internally, potentially avoiding a lot of unnecessary work.

# Version 0.2.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed JSONPath filter operator precedence. Previously logical _and_ (`&&`) and _or_ (`||`) were binding more tightly than logical negation (`!`).

# Version 0.2.0

**Breaking Changes**

- Rename `JSONPathEnvironment.filterRegister` to `JSONPathEnvironment.functionRegister`.
- Removed `JSONPathEnvironment.options` in favour of equivalent environment properties. For example, `JSONPathEnvironment.options.maxIntIndex` is now `JSONPathEnvironment.maxIntIndex`.

**Fixes**

- Fixed well-typedness checks on function calls. Previously we were throwing a `JSONPathTypError` for some valid queries.
- Fixed parsing of function calls with comparison expressions as arguments.
- Fixed a bug with unbalanced parentheses detection in JSONPath expressions when parsing nested function calls. In some cases we were not throwing a `JSONPathSyntaxError` when a function was not closed, but an inner function was.

**Features**

- Implemented [Relative JSON Pointers](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-hha-relative-json-pointer-00.html). Use the `to(rel)` method of `JSONPointer`, where `rel` is a relative JSON pointer string and a new `JSONPointer` is returned.
- Guard against recursive data structures by implementing the `JSONPathEnvironment.maxRecursionDepth` option. When using the recursive descent selector (`..`), if the maximum recursion depth is reached, a `JSONPathRecursionLimitError` is thrown.
- Added `JSONPathEnvironment.match()` and `JSONPath.match()`, which returns a `JSONPathNode` for the first value matching a query, or `undefined` if there are no matches.

# Version 0.1.1

**Fixes**

- Fix number literals with an implicit exponent sign. Previously we would see a `JSONPathSyntaxError` for `1e2`, but not for `1e+2` or `1e-2`. Now `1e2` is equivalent to `1e+2`.

# Version 0.1.0

Initial release.
